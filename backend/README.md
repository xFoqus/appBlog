# Express Base Application for API Creation

This is a basic Express application template designed to help you create APIs
quickly. It includes essential configurations and setup for starting an Express
server.

## Features

- Basic Express server setup
- CORS enabled
- Environment configuration with `.env` support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them
from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mariogiron/express-init-template.git project-name
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd project-name
```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and configure your environment
variables. An example `.env` file might look like this:

```
PORT=3000
```

### Running the Application

#### Start the server

Start the server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start and listen on the port defined in your `.env` file, or
default to port 3000 if not specified.

#### Development mode

To start the server in development mode with `nodemon`, which will automatically
restart the server on file changes, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Available Scripts

- **start**: Runs `node index.js` to start the server.
- **dev**: Runs `nodemon index.js` to start the server in development mode with
  automatic restarts on file changes.
- **generate**: Runs `express generate` to create any resource inside your
  project. The actions available are "model", "controller", "route", "all"
- **config**: Runs `express config` to config the date of your project.
